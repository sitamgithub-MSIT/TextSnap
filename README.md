[**Florence-2**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06242) is an advanced vision foundation model developed by Microsoft, designed to handle a wide range of vision and vision-language tasks using a prompt-based approach. This model can interpret simple text prompts to perform functions like captioning, object detection, and segmentation. Its sequence-to-sequence architecture enables outstanding performance in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, making it a highly competitive vision foundation model. This project utilizes [**Florence-2**](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large-ft) to demonstrate robust OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities, offering both text extraction and enhanced visualization of recognized text regions in images.

## Tech Stack

- Python (for the programming language)
- PyTorch (for the deep learning framework)
- Supervision (for the easy-to-use utils for Computer Vision tasks)
- Hugging Face Transformers Library (for the vision large language model)
- Gradio (for the web application)
- Hugging Face Spaces (for hosting the gradio application)

## Usage

The web application allows you to upload an image, and the OCR models will extract text from it, providing two main functionalities: **text extraction** and **text visualization**.

- Text extraction cleans and formats the extracted text, ensuring proper spacing between words and after punctuation marks.
- Text visualization draws bounding boxes around recognized text regions on the image, offering a clear and enhanced visual representation.

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Upload an image containing text that you want to extract and visualize.
3. Click the **Submit** button to process the image.
4. The application will display the extracted text and the image with bounding boxes around the recognized text regions.
5. You can download the processed image with bounding boxes or copy the extracted text to your clipboard.
6. You can also share the application results with others by clicking the **Share via Link** button.
7. Click the **Clear** button to clear the input and output fields.

This application can assist in document digitization, automated data entry, and improved accessibility for visually impaired individuals by recognizing text from images.
